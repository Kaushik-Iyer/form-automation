# form-automation

A form automation project that I made for an assignment. This is my first time using the selenium module.
The code does the following things:
1. Fills initial form
2. Creates new batches and fills them up too
3. Presses continue to go to the next page
4. Fills in personal details and payment details
5. Presses next twice and waits for the payment page to load up
6. Fills in all the credit card details required

All the form details are also automatically filled by reading through a .csv file, row wise.
